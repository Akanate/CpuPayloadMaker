This is a payload maker made to crash computers and is recommended with virtual computers if you want to use but can be used on normal computers if not ran for too long but I will not be responsible if any damage is done to a another person's computer or your personal computer.
The main aspect of this payload maker is the fact its simple its reliable and it basically overloads your cpu.
